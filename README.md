# Code-Red
A multiplayer game inspired by the likes of FTL: Faster Than Light and Space Alert.

## Compiling
To compile, you will need the following installed and configured on your build machine:
* Java JDK 1.8.+
* Gradle 4.1+

You can build directly with Gradle if you wish, but if you want to reproduce a historical build call `gradle wrapper` to automatically generate the correct wrapper, then use `gradlew` commands to build.
